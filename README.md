# LeetCode Blind 75

- This is my journey to solve 75 DSA problems to prepare for a coding interview during this I'll be documenting approches and solution code.
- If you need the code from this repo you can fork and use it or just clone it.
- All the documentation is in the docs folder. The naming is odd because it's all exported from notion.
